<h1>React Interview Questions</h1>
<p>Expected intermediate understanding of React and redux concepts.</p>


<p>What is React?</p>
<p>Differentiate React vs other frameworks?</p>
<p>What is component lifecycle?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Explain High-Level component lifecycle?</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Initialization</li>
    <li>State/Property Updates</li>
    <li>Destruction</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>Explain low-level component lifecycle?</li>
</ul>
<p>What is JSX?</p>
<p>What is Flux?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Flux is an architectural pattern that enforces unidirectional data flow &mdash;&nbsp;its core purpose is to control derived data so that multiple components can interact with that data without risking pollution.</li>
    <li>The strict unidirectional flow of this Flux pattern enforces data stability, reducing data-related runtime errors throughout an application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pros of Flux:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Poorly defined data flow can be easily controlled by store.</li>
    <li>Lack of data integrity &ndash; enforced by restricting direct access to shared data.</li>
</ol>
<p>What are stateless components?</p>
<ul>
    <li>These are pure functions that render DOM based on properties</li>
</ul>
<p>What is setState?</p>
<p>What is forceUpdate?</p>
<p>setState vs forceUpdate?</p>
<p>Element vs Component?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Element: simple UI</li>
    <li>Component: function or class that accepts input and returns UI</li>
</ul>
<p>Class component vs functional component?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Class component has state or lifecycle methods</li>
    <li>Functional components: simple render the assigned function</li>
</ul>
<p>Refs?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Used to access DOM elements or instance of a component</li>
    <li>Can be used to maintain uncontrolled componets</li>
</ul>
<p>Keys?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Keys are the way of tracking data in react. Suggested to have unique keys for all the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Controlled vs uncontrolled components?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Controlled: is in control &ndash; can be manipulated as needed</li>
    <li>Uncontrolled: simply renders DOM data</li>
</ul>
<p>Where are AJAX calls placed in react lifecycle?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Inside of componentDidMount event</li>
</ul>
<p>When to use shouldCompoentUpdate?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Can be used to opt out of any process and update the UI as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>How to set production build in react?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Set NODE_ENV to production &ndash; this will avoid proptype validation errors and other warnings.</li>
</ul>
<p>How to get data from state?</p>
<p>Define state?</p>
<p>Thunk vs sagas?</p>
<p>Is redux a framework or library?</p>
<p>What are middlewares?</p>
<p>Explain the process of unit testing?</p>
<p>What is describe, it, assert?</p>
<p>How are promises handled?</p>
<p>What are promises?</p>
<p>What is a callback?</p>
<p>What is callbackhell?</p>
<p>What is setTimeOut?</p>
<p>what happens when a promise is failed?</p>
<p>Explain the life cycle of an action?</p>
<p>What is a Reducer?</p>
<p>Explain Routing?</p>
<p>How does data flow in reducers?</p>
<p>Where are middlewares placed in a lifecycle of action?</p>
